Since we need WiFi interface anyway to provide access to Elo's measurements,
it's quite convenient to use this interface to configure Elo.

Why configure Elo using WiFi and not using the device itself?
It will be simpler to implement configuration over WiFi rather than
implementing configuration on the device itself. The second option will
require more code, time and effort to implement different states of the Settings view.

Another reason for that is that LCD is too small (16x2) to provide a convenient Settings UI.
